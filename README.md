# Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
In this project I had to develop an NPC intelligent agent that navigates the game world, through obstacles and pathways to get to the finish line. The goal is to beat the human player to the finish which is the treasure spot. The code given was a sample environment, a maze object, and a full game based on a previous provided trained model. The code I created was the Q-training algorithm. The code made the intelligent agent randomly select a cell, reset the maze, observe what state the game was in, reward or give a penalty, and determine if the agent won or lost. 

# Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
# What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer Scientists design, develop, and analyze hardware and software. This matters because without computer scientists the future would look bleak. Computer scientists solve many problems and prepare for the future. Ai is one of the technologies that will be an enormous part of our lives once it becomes mainstream. 

# How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
I approach a problem very logically as a computer scientist. Logic is the basis to many problems in the world today and if we approach problems like this more often than not we will find the route cause very easily.

# What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
I believe my ethical responsibilities to the end user and company is to try to make sure there are no biases, fair coding practices are used, being transparent when possible, and making sure that people understand what is being coded so they can make their best decision when using it.
